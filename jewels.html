          <p class="jewel-description">
            n 1689 Queen Mary II was crowned joint sovereign with her husband
            King William III. As joint monarch Mary II required her own regalia
            for their coronation, rather than using the traditional consort’s
            regalia.

          <p class="jewel-description">
            The Imperial State Crown is the crown that the monarch wears as they
            leave Westminster Abbey after the coronation. It is also used on
            other State occasions including the annual State Opening of
            Parliament.

          <p class="jewel-description">
            One of the oldest objects in the Crown Jewels is the 12th-century
            Coronation Spoon. It is used for anointing the sovereign with holy
            oil, the most sacred part of the coronation ceremony.

          <p class="jewel-description">
            The Sovereign’s Sceptre with Cross has been used at every coronation
            since Charles II’s in 1661. It was transformed in 1910 for George V
            by the addition of the spectacular Cullinan I diamond. At 530.2
            carats, it is the largest colourless cut diamond in the world.

          <p class="jewel-description">
            One of the Queen’s most recognisable crowns is the Vladimir Tiara
            which once belonged to her grandmother, Queen Mary. The unique piece
            can be altered to feature droplets of either pearls or cabochon
            emeralds.

            <p class="jewel-description">
              This tiara was gifted to Princess Elizabeth by her parents on her
              18th birthday. Her father, George VI, commissioned it as an
              anniversary gift for his wife. Although Elizabeth was never
              publicly photographed wearing the tiara, she often loaned it to
              her sister and her daughter.
