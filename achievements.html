          </h3>
          <p class="achievement-description">
            Regarded as a historic trip to Ireland, the queen was the first
            British monarch to visit in 100 years. She was widely applauded for
            the four-day trip that took place in 2011. The visit demonstrated
            peace and an improved relationship between the two countries.

            On December 25th, 2020, the Queen gave one of the most powerful
            speeches of the year. Her Christmas broadcast touched the hearts of
            many separated from family and friends due to the pandemic. “Of
            course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness:
            some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing
            friends and family members distanced for safety, when all they’d
            really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand,”
            the queen said in a video. “If you are among them, you are not
            alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.”
